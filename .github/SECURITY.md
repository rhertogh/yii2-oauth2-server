Please use the [security issue form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfiJD1loIfsPtdLi6e0d7cyqtElXOrX_mdVAF6cTJJRDy1JOA/viewform) to report to us any security issue you find in the Yii2-Oauth2-Server.  
DO NOT use the issue tracker or discuss it in the public forum as it will cause more damage than help.
