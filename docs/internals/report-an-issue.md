* Provide the **complete** error call stack if available. A screenshot to explain the issue is very welcome.
* Describe the steps for reproducing the issue. It would be even better if you could provide code to reproduce the issue.

**Do not report an issue if**

* You're asking how to use some feature. You should use [the Yii forum](
